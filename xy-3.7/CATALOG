Description: Xy-pic is a package for typesetting graphs and diagrams.
 It is structured as several modules, each defining a custom notation for
 a particular kind of graphical object or structure. Example objects are
 arrows, curves, frames, and colouring/rotation on drivers that support
 it; these can be organised in matrix, directed graph, path, polygon, knot,
 and 2-cell structure. Xy-pic works with most formats, including LaTeX,
 AMS-LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and plain TeX, and has been used to typeset
 complicated diagrams from many application areas including category
 theory, automata theory, algebra, neural networks, and database theory.

Keywords: diagram, picture, graph, arrow, curve, commutative diagram.
