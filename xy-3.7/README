	======================================================
	THE Xy-pic PACKAGE FOR TYPESETTING GRAPHS AND DIAGRAMS
	======================================================

Xy-pic is a package for typesetting graphs and diagrams with TeX.

It works with most formats, including LaTeX (both 2.09 and 2e),
AMS-LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and plain TeX.

It has been used to typeset complicated diagrams from many application
areas including category theory, automata theory, algebra, neural
networks, and database theory.

Xy-pic is structured as a `kernel' and several orthogonal modules called
`options', each defining a custom notation for a particular kind of
graphical object or structure.

These (combinable) structures are available:

* A graph combinator mode where diagrams are specified the way they are
  composed as graphs.

* A matrix-like mode where the dimensions of the drawing are computed by
  aligning diagram entries in rows and columns (this is the `diagram'
  mode Xy-pic version 2 users are used to).

* A polygon mode where diagrams shaped as regular polygons are entered
  in a simple way.

* A mode for typesetting beautiful knots and links.

* A general object-oriented `turtle graphic' drawing language for
  specifying graphs with objects and connections between them in a
  manner independent of orientation.

The following objects may be used:

+ Positions can be given in variety of formats (extendable) including
  user defined coordinates (x,y) and relative to previous positions,
  objects, object edges, and points on connections.

+ Objects may be circular, elliptic, or rectangular (more shapes can be
  added) and adjusted in several ways.

+ Large library of objects with mnemonic names.

+ Objects that orient themself along a connection when placed relative
  to it, e.g., `\dir{|-}' is like \vdash but thus oriented; new such
  objects can be defined in a convenient way.

+ TeX `boxes', i.e., text and mathematical formulae.

+ Includes circle segments and optionally arbitrary elliptical,
  quadratic, and cubic arcs.

+ Connections are aligned between the reference points of objects but
  start and end on the edges.

+ Any object can be used to build a connection (using `diagonal
  filling'); library objects provide common line types.

+ Flexible notation for drawing arrows and general paths with tail,
  stem, and head built from any object(s).  Special support for arrows
  that cross each other, arrows that `go by' other entries, paired
  arrows (including support for 2-cells), curved arrows, and arrows with
  bends.

+ Library of frames and braces.

+ Special notation for rotation, scaling, colour, and line thickness.
  The correct typesetting of these features requires a backend that
  supports it (i.e., PostScript) but even when this is not available
  Xy-pic tries to approximate what is requested such that at least the
  picture size is stable (and thus page breaks).

+ Output can use PostScript for drawing (several \special formats are
  supported: dvips, Textures, and OzTeX -- more are being added
  continuously: contact Ross Moore <ross@mpce.mq.edu.au> for the current
  list).  Notation for inclusion of literal PostScript is available.

* Other graphics can be imported and then `decorated' using Xy-pic.

All object forms may be used with all structures.
