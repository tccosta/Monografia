Eberhard Matte's {em-\TeX} implementation provides a suite of |\special| 
commands to facilitate the drawing of lines, both on-screen and with various
printing devices. This `back-end' extension allows the lines in \Xy-pic
diagrams to be drawn using these methods.

Note that this extension does not have to be used with {em-\TeX}. Better
results may be obtained using the \PS\ back-end and \dvips\ <driver>, since
a version of \dvips\ is available for em-\TeX. However, in particular for 
screen previewing purposes, it may be convenient to use this back-end.
Furthermore note that \dvips\ is capable of supporting em-\TeX |\special|s.

Once loaded using |\xyoption{emtex}|, with an appropriate <driver> also
specified either already or subsequently, the following commands are
available to turn the em-\TeX\ backend off/on.
%
\begin{defs}
|\NoEMspecials| & turns off em-\TeX\ specials.\kern-50pt\cr
|\UseEMspecials| & reinstates em-\TeX\ specials.\kern-30pt
\end{defs}

\DOCMODE(
\xynew@{if}\ifEMspecials@
\xydef@\UseEMspecials{\EMspecials@true}
\xydef@\NoEMspecials{\EMspecials@false}
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{The |\special|s}

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\xyemtex@lineto{\xyEM@special{lineto}} 
\xydef@\xyemtex@moveto{\xyEM@special{moveto}} 
\xydef@\xyemtex@line#1{\xyEM@special{line #1}} 
\xydef@\xyemtex@point#1{\xyEM@special{point #1}} 
\xydef@\xyemtex@pen#1{\addtostyletoks@{\xyEM@special{linewidth #1}}}
\DOCMODE)

These place the actual |\special|s and allow tracing:

\DOCMODE(
{\catcode`:=12 \gdef\next#1{\special{em:#1}}}
\xylet@\xyEM@special=\next

{\catcode`:=12 \gdef\next#1{%
 \W@{EM:#1 (\the\X@p,\the\Y@p),(\the\X@c,\the\Y@c)}\special{em:#1}}}
\xylet@\xyEM@noisy=\next

\xydef@\NoisyEMTeX{\let\xyEM@special=\xyEM@noisy}
\DOCMODE)

Currently these are not used by \Xy-pic.

\DOCMODE(
%\xydef@\xyemtex@message#1{\xyEM@special{message #1}}
%\xydef@\xyemtex@graph#1{\xyEM@special{graph #1}}
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{re-bindings}

This is similar to the mechanism used by the \PS\ back-end to rebind
``hooks'' to incorporate a switch according to the current value of
|\ifEMspecials@|.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\EMalternative@#1#2{%
\expandafter\global\expandafter\let\csname origxy#2@\endcsname=#1%
 \xdef#1{\noexpand\ifEMspecials@
   \noexpand\expandafter\expandafter\noexpand\csname xyemtex@#2@\endcsname
  \noexpand\else
   \noexpand\expandafter\expandafter\noexpand\csname origxy#2@\endcsname
  \noexpand\fi}}%
\DOCMODE)

Allow only one instance of |\setupxyEM@|; thereafter simply do
|\reloadxyEM@| to turn on anything that has been turned off.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\setupxyEMTeX@{\xywarning@{using em-TeX specials}%
 \EMalternative@{\solid@}{solid}%
% \EMalternative@{\point@}{point}%

 \let\setupxyEM@=\reloadxyEM@ 
 \activateEM@ }

% \xywithoption{curve}{\xysetup@@\uninstallEMcurves@ }%
 \xywithoption{line}{\xysetup@@\uninstallEMline@ }%
% \xywithoption{frame}{\xysetup@@\uninstallEMframes@ }%
 \EMspecials@false
 \let\setupxyEM@=\reloadxyEM@ }

\xydef@\activateEM@{%
 \xywithoption{line}{\xysetup@@\installEMline@}%
% \xywithoption{curve}{\xysetup@@\installEMcurves@}%

Of the curves defined in the |xycurve| extension, only solid spline curves 
are supported. This is done by treating the spline as a polygon (poly-line)
