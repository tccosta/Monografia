This feature provides the ability to easy add labels and annotations to
graphics prepared outside \TeX\ or \LaTeX. An \Xy-pic graphics environment
is established whose coordinates match that within the contents of the
imported graphic, making it easy to specify exactly where a label should be
placed, or arrow drawn to highlight a particular feature.

A command |\xyimport| is defined which is used, in conjunction with
imported graphics, to establish a coordinate system appropriate to the
particular graphics. This enables <pos>itions within the graphic to be easily
located, either for labelling or adding extra embellishing features. 
It is used in either of the follow ways:
%
\begin{defs1} 
|\xyimport(|{\em width}|,|{\em height}|){|<graphic>|}| \cr
|\xyimport(|{\em width}|,|{\em height}|)(|%
 {\em$x$-off}|,|{$y$-off}|){|<graphic>|}| 
\end{defs1} 

\begin{code}
\def\ellipA{\resizebox{6cm}{!}{%
  \includegraphics{import1.eps}}}
\xy
\xyimport(3.7,3.7)(1.4,1.4){\ellipA}*\frm{-}
,!D+<2pc,-1pc>*+!U\txt{%

\qquad\qquad
\xy\xyimport(3.7,3.7)(1.4,1.4){\ellipA}

\noindent
Normally the <graphics> will be a box containing a graphic imported
using the commands from packages such as |graphics|, |epsf| or
|epsfig|, or using other commands provided by the local \TeX\
implementation. However the <graphic> could be {\em any} balanced
\TeX\ material whatsoever; provided it occupies non-zero size, both
vertically and horizontally.

The {\em width} and {\em height} are <number>s given in the coordinate
system for the {\em contents of the <graphics>}. These are not dimensions,
but coordinate-lengths, using the units appropriate to the picture displayed
by <graphic>. 

When provided, |(|{\em$x$-off}|,|{$y$-off}|)| give the distance in
coordinate units from bottom-left corner to where the origin of coordinates 
should be located, usually within area covered by the <graphic>. 
Usually the negatives of these numbers will give the coordinate location
of the bottom-left corner of the <graphic>. If no offsets are supplied
then the origin is presumed to lie at the bottom-left corner.

Normally the |\xyimport| command is used at the beginning of an |\xy..\endxy|
environment. It is not necessary to give any basis setup, for this is
deduced by measuring the dimensions of the <graphic> and using the supplied
{\em width}, {\em height} and offsets.
The <graphic> itself defines named <pos> called |"import"|, located at the 
origin and having appropriate extents to describe the area covered by
the <graphic>. This makes it particularly easy to surround the <graphic> 
with a frame, as on the left side of figure~??[importing],
or to draw axes passing through the origin.

% Special care needed in case there is no graphics available...
\ifx\includegraphics\undefined \def\resizebox#1#2#3{%
  \vbox to6cm{\vss\hbox to6cm{\hss(Picture import1.eps omitted)\hss}\vss}}\fi

Here is the code used to apply the labelling in figure~??[importing]: 
\displaycode

This example uses the \LaTeXe\ standard |graphics| package to import
the graphics file |import1.eps|; other packages could have been used
instead.  e.g. |epsfig|, |epsf|, or the \expandafter|\string\picture|
or \expandafter|\string\illustration| commands in \Textures\ on the
Macintosh.

The only possible problems that can occur are when the graphics package is 
loaded after \Xy-pic has been loaded. Generally it is advisable to have 
\Xy-pic loading {\em after} all other macro packages.
