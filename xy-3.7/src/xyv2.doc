\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	This \FILE\ describes the special backwards compatibility with
	\Xy-pic version~2: diagrams written according to the ``Typesetting
	diagrams with \Xy-pic: User's Manual''~\cite{R92:TypesettingDXUM}
	should typeset correctly with this loaded.  The compatibility is
	available either as an \Xy-option or through the special files
	|xypic.sty| and |xypic.tex| described below.

	There are a few exceptions to the compatibility: the features described
	in~\S??[unsupported] below are not provided because they are not as
	useful as the author originally thought and thus virtually never
	used.  And one extra command is provided to speed up typesetting of
	documents with \Xy-pic version~2 diagrams by allowing the new
	compilation functionality with old diagrams.

	The remaining sections list all the obsolete commands and suggest
	ways to achieve the same things using \Xy-pic \xyversion, \ie,
	without the use of this option.  They are grouped as to what part of
	\Xy-pic replaces them; the compilation command is described last.

	\NOTE: ``version 2'' is meant to cover all public releases of \Xy-pic
	in 1991 and 1992, \ie, version 1.40 and versions~2.1 through~2.6.
	The published manual cited above (for version 2.6) is the reference
	in case of variations between these versions, and only things
	documented in that manual will be supported by this
	option!\footnote{In addition a few of the experimental facilities
	supported in v2.7--2.12 are also supported.}

\subsection{Unsupported incompatibilities}
??=[unsupported]

	Here is a list of known incompatibilities with version 2 even when
	the |v2| option is loaded.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
	Automatic `shortening' of arrow tails using ??c![|<<] breaks was a 
	bug and has been `fixed' so it does not work any more.  
	Put a |||<\hole| break before it.
\item
	The version~2.6 ??c![*] position operator is not available.  The
	version 2.6 construction $t_0|;|t_1|*(|x|,|y|)|$ should be replaced by
	the rather long but equivalent construction
$$
\begin{array}{r@{}l}
 |{|\,t_0\,|;p+/r/:|\,t_1\,|=|&|"1";p+/u/,x;(0,0);:|\\
   &|"1";p+/r/,y;(0,0);::|\,|(|x|,|y|)}|
\end{array}
$$
	In most cases $t_0|;|t_1|**{}?(|x|)|$,
	possibly with a trailing $|+/^|\dots|/|$, suffices instead.
\item
	Using $t_0|;|t_1|:(|x|,|y|)|$ as the target of an arrow command does
	not work.  Enclose it in braces, \ie, write
$$
 |{|\,t_0\,|;|\,t_1\,|:(|x|,|y|)}|
$$
\item
	The older ??c![\pit], ??c![\apit], and ??c![\bpit] commands are not
	defined.  Use |\dir{>}| (or |\tip|) with variants and rotation.
\item
	The even older notation where an argument in braces to |\rto| and the
	others was automatically taken to be a `tail' is not supported.  Use
	the supported |||<|\dots\ notation.
\end{itemize}
%
	If you do not use these features then your version~2 (and earlier)
	diagrams should typeset the same with this option loaded except that
	sometimes the spacing with version~3 is slightly different from that
	of version~2.6 which had some spacing bugs.

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection{Obsolete kernel features}
??=[kernel]

	The following things are added to the kernel by this option and
	described here: idioms, obsolete positions, obsolete connections, and
	obsolete objects.  For each we show the suggested way of doing the
	same thing without this option:

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Removed \protect\AMS-\TeX\ idioms}

	Some idioms from \AMS-\TeX\ are no longer used by \Xy-pic: the
	definition commands ??c![\define] and ??c![\redefine], and the size
	commands ??c![\dsize], ??c![\tsize], ??c![\ssize], and ??c![\sssize].
	Please use the commands recommended for your format---for plain \TeX\
	these are |\def| for the first two and |\displaystyle|, |\textstyle|,
	|\scriptstyle|, and |\scriptscriptstyle| for the rest.  The |v2|
	option ensures that they are available anyway.

\DOCMODE(
\ifx\redefine\undefined \let\redefine=\def \fi
\ifx\define\undefined \let\define=\xydef@ \fi

\ifx\dsize\undefined \let\dsize=\displaystyle \fi
\ifx\tsize\undefined \let\dsize=\textstyle \fi
\ifx\ssize\undefined \let\ssize=\scriptstyle \fi
\ifx\sssize\undefined \let\sssize=\scriptscriptstyle \fi
\DOCMODE)

	Version also 2 used the \AMS-\TeX\ ??c![\text] and a (non-object) box
	construction ??c![\Text] which are emulated---|\text| is only defined
	if not already defined, however, using the native one (of \AMS-\TeX\
	or \AMS-\LaTeX\ or whatever) if possible.  Please use the |\txt|
	object construction described in~\S??g[xy.doc:objectlib.text]
	directly since it is more general and much more efficient!

\DOCMODE(
\ifx\text\undefined
 \def\text{\relax\textC}%

\subsubsection*{Obsolete state}

	Upto version 2.6 users could access the state variables ??c![\cL],
	??c![\cR], ??c![\cH], and ??c![\cD], which are defined.

\DOCMODE(
\xylet@\cL=\L@c
\xylet@\cR=\R@c
\xylet@\cD=\D@c
\xylet@\cH=\U@c
\DOCMODE)

	From v2.7 to 2.12 users could use the names of the state |\dimen|
	registers ??c![\Xmin], ??c![\Xmax], ??c![\Ymin], and ??c![\Ymax];
	??c![\Xp], ??c![\Yp] ??c![\Dp], ??c![\Up], ??c![\Lp], and ??c![\Rp];
	??c![\Xc], ??c![\Yc] ??c![\Dc], ??c![\Uc], ??c![\Lc], and ??c![\Rc];
	??c![\Xorigin], ??c![\Yorigin], ??c![\Xxbase], ??c![\Yxbase],
	??c![\Xybase], and ??c![\Yybase].  Now the same effect can be
	achieved using <corner>s but |v2| defines the aliases.

\subsubsection*{Obsolete position manipulation}

	In version~2 many things were done using individual <decor> control
	sequences that are now done using <pos> operators.
%
\begin{defs}

\subsection{Obsolete extensions \& features}
??=[extensions]??=[features]

	Version~2 had commutative diagram functionality corresponding to the
	|frames| extension and parts of the |matrix| and |arrow| features.
	These are therefore loaded and some extra definitions added to
	emulate commands that have disappeared.

\subsubsection*{Frames}

	The version 2 frame commands are emulated using the frame extension
	(as well as the |\dotframed|, |\dashframed|, |\rounddashframed|
	commands comm\-unicated to some users by electronic mail):
%
\begin{defs}

\subsubsection*{Matrices}

	The ??c![\diagram] <rows> ??c![\enddiagram] command is provided as an
	alias for |\xymatrix{| <rows> |}| centered in math mode and
	??c![\LaTeXdiagrams] changes it to use |\begin| \dots\ |\end| syntax.
	|v2| sets a special internal `old matrix' flag such that
	trailing~|\\| are ignored and entries starting with~|*| are safe.

\subsubsection*{Arrows}

	The main arrow commands of version 2 were the ??c![\morphism] and
	??c![\definemorphism] commands which now have been replaced by the
	|\ar| command.

	|v2| provides them as well as uses them to define the version~2
	commands ??c![\xto], ??c![\xline], ??c![\xdashed], ??c![\xdotted],
	??c![\xdouble], and all the derived commands |\dto|, |\urto|, \dots;
	the |\arrow| commands of the $\beta$-releases of v3 is also provided.

	Instead of commands like |\rrto| and |\uldouble| you should use the
	arrow feature replacements |\ar[rr]| and |\ar@{=}[ul]|.

	The predefined turning solid arrows |\lltou|, \dots, |\tord| are
	defined as well; these are now easy to do with <turn>s.

\subsection{Obsolete loading}
??=[loading]

	The v2 User's Manual says that you can load \Xy-pic with the command
	??c![\input xypic] and as a \LaTeX~2.09 `style option' |[xypic]|.
	This is made synonymous with loading this option by the files
	??c![xypic.tex] and ??c![xypic.sty] distributed with the |v2| option.

\subsection{Compiling v2-diagrams}
??=[compiling]

	In order to make it possible to use the new compilation features even
	on documents written with \Xy-pic v2, the following command was
	added in v2.12:
%
\begin{defs1}
|\diagramcompileto{| <name> |}| \dots\ |\enddiagram| \cr
\end{defs1}
\noindent\unskip
%
	which is like the ordinary diagram command except the result is
	compiled (see note~??g[xy.doc:compile]).  Note that compilation is
	not quite safe in all cases!

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\diagramcompileto#1#2\enddiagram{\relax
 \diagram@{\NoCompileMatrices\xycompileto{#1}}{#2}}
\DOCMODE)

	There is also the following command that switches on "automatic
	compilation" of all diagrams created with the v2 |\diagram| \dots\
	|\enddiagram| command:
%
\begin{defs1}
|\CompileAllDiagrams| |{| <prefix> |}| \cr
|\NoCompileAllDiagrams| \cr
|\ReCompileAllDiagrams| \cr
\end{defs1}
\noindent\unskip
%
	will apply |\xycompileto{|<prefix>$n$|}{|\dots|}| to each diagram
	with~$n$ a sequence number starting from~1.  Use |\CompileMatrices|
	and |\CompilePrefix| instead!

	If for some reason a diagram does not work when compiled then replace
	the |\diagram| command with |\diagramnocompile| (or in case you are
	using the \LaTeX\ form, |\begin{diagramnocompile}|).
