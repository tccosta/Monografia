\subsection{Frames}

The included file |xyps-f.tex| (version \stripRCS$Revision: 3.7 $) provides
\PS\ support for the effects defined in the |frame| extension described
in~\S??g[:frame].  It implements some effects otherwise unattainable.

This file is loaded and its effects are activated automatically whenever
|\xyoption{frame}| is requested and the current <driver> supports \PS\
effects for frames. Should there be any need to turn off this support, the
following commands are available; they obey usual \TeX\ groupings.
%
\begin{defs}
|\NoPSframes| & remove \PS\ support\kern-50pt \cr
|\UsePSframes| & reinstate \PS.
\end{defs}
%
Without \PS\ support ellipses may be shown as circles and all filled
regions may be represented as black rectangles.
These commands are provided primarily for testing and trouble-shooting; 
\eg~with <driver> configurations untested by the authors of \Xy-pic, 
who should be notified of any difficulties. 

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{Installation}

The <driver>-file must call the following macro to rebind control sequences 
defined in |xyframe|, thereby allowing the \PS\ methods to be used.

\paragraph*{Frames: solid, dotted and dashed}

For solid frames use \PS\ ovals, otherwise adjust the spacing between dashes 
or dots according to the lengths, both vertical and horizontal.

In practice the parameters |#1| and |#2| will hold <dimen>s.

\paragraph*{ovals and circles}

The width, height, corner-radius are available as |\dimen@i|, |\dimen@ii| 
and |\R@| respectively; we only need |\R@| here, 
since the extents hold the real information that we need.

The \PS\ operators |ov|, |ox| etc.  are defined within |xyps-pro|, 
having scope limited to |XYdict| and sub-dictionaries.

}
\DOCMODE)

Rectangles are treated as a special case of ovals.
The |#2| parameter signifies whether the outline of the object 
should also be stroked (|#2|=|\relax|) after being filled.
Such a stroke is always in black.
