As a special convenience, this feature loads a subset of
\Xy-pic,\footnote{The name `all' hints at the fact that these were all the
  available options at the time `all' was added.} namely the extensions:
|curve| (\cf~\S??g[:curve]), |frame| (\S??g[:frame]), |cmtip| (\S??g[:tips]),
|line| (\S??g[:line]), |rotate| (\S??g[:rotate]), |color| (\S??g[:color]),
and the following features: |matrix| (\S??g[:matrix]), |arrow|
(\S??g[:arrow]), and |graph| (\S??g[:graph]).

Here we go:

\DOCMODE(
\xyrequire{curve}
\xyrequire{frame}
\xyrequire{cmtip}
\xyrequire{line}
\xyrequire{rotate}
\xyrequire{color}

\xyrequire{matrix}
\xyrequire{arrow}
\xyrequire{graph}
\DOCMODE)

That is all.
