\subsection{Colour}

The included file |xyps-c.tex| (version \stripRCS$Revision: 3.7 $) provides
\PS\ support for the effects defined in the |color| extension
in~\S??g[:color].

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \PS\ style methods are required, so ensure that they are loaded.

\DOCMODE(
\expandafter\ifx \csname xyps-sloaded\endcsname\empty\else
 \xyinputorelse@{xyps-s}{\xyerror@{Could not load xyps-s}{}}%
 \xycatcodes\fi
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This file is loaded and its effects are activated automatically whenever
|\xyoption{color}| is requested and the current <driver> supports 
colours using \PS. Should there be any need to turn off this support,
the following commands are available; they obey usual \TeX\ groupings.
%
\begin{defs}
|\NoPScolor| & remove \PS\ support\kern-50pt\cr
|\UsePScolor| & reinstate \PS.
\end{defs}
%
Without \PS\ support some drivers may still be able to provide some
support for colours. These commands are not guaranteed to work adequately 
with all drivers. They are provided primarily for testing and 
trouble-shooting; \eg~with <driver> configurations untested by the 
authors of \Xy-pic, who should be notified of any difficulties.

\paragraph*{Installation}

Installation consists of rebinding the macros |\xycolor@| and |\newxycolor@|
and of reloading the standard colours to include a description for \PS.
This installation should be delayed till after |color| and |ps| themselves
have been installed. 

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\installPScolor@{\installPSstyle@
 \let\xymath@=\xyPSmath@ \let\xynomath@=\xyPSnomath@
 \let\checkxyPScolor@=\checkxyPScolor@@
 \let\xycolor@@=\xyPScolor@@
 \xystandardcolors@ 
 \xyuncatcodes }
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

All effects defined in the |color| extension can
be implemented using the \PS\ dictionary, loaded by |xyps-ps|. 
This file provides ``generic'' \PS\ code which is known to work
correctly with most drivers. No attempt is made to provide special
code for particular drivers; for driver-specific variations, consult
the appropriate |xy|<driver>|.doc| file.
