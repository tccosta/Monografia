This driver provides support for version 1.7+ of Blue Sky Research's
\Textures\ application for Macintosh\footnote{Macintosh is a trademark of
Apple Computer Inc.}.  It incorporates support for colour and all of
\Xy-pic's \PS\ effects.  Earlier versions of \Textures\ should instead use
the driver option |\xyoption{16textures}|.

Notice that version 1.7 suffers from a printing bug which may cause a \PS\
error.  A fix is kludged by making sure the first page has been shown in the
viewer before any pages with diagrams are sent to the printer.

Supported |\special| effects are...
%
\begin{itemize}

\item colour, both on-screen and with \PS\ 

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Textures uses the colour-stack method, but it requires a separate
|\special| to set the new colour after having pushed the previous colour
onto the stack.

\item crayon colours.

The 68 colours are those that |dvips| recognizes by name, 
thanks to Tomas Rokicki.

Versions 1.7 and later of \Textures\ have the following kinds of |\special|, 
the first two executing in the environment defined by the dictionary 
|userdict|. In particular these versions of \Textures\ now allow the 
\PS\ dictionary to be loaded into the main working dictionary.

\begin{itemize}
\item |\special{rawpostscript #1}| puts code directly into the \PS\ file.
\item |\special{postscript #1}| wraps the code within |sps|...|eps|, 
which involves a basis change within a |save/restore| pair.
\item |\special{prePostScript #1}| places the \PS\ code within the header
dictionary, called |TeXdict|.
\end{itemize}
Each of these has a corresponding version for reading the \PS\ commands 
from a file.

The |currentpoint| is defined for the ``raw'' specials.
For Textures this is the same as |\xyPScurrpt@@@|, in |xyps-ps.doc|.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\texturesCurrpt@{\let\xyPScurrpt@@=\texturesCurrpt@@}%

% \PSraw@@{userdict begin /xyYpos exch def /xyXpos exch def end}}
\DOCMODE)

The \PS\ operator called |xyx| is defined in |xyps-ps| for storing the
location placed on the stack by |xyi|.

\medskip

This installs the \PS\ backend.
