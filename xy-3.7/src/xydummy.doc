\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	This option is provided as a template for new options, it provides
	neither features nor extensions but it does count how many times it
	is requested.
\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	Even though the option does nothing it still has a standard \Xy-pic
	header:

\DOCHEADER

	Next follows two declarations that are used to count the number of
	invocations:

\DOCMODE(
\xynew@{count}\xydummyrequires@@
\DOCMODE)

	This is used by the option to output a message every time it is
	loaded with |\xyoption| or |\xyrequire|:

\DOCMODE(
\xyeveryrequest{dummy}{\global\advance\xydummyrequires@@\@ne
 \W@{The `dummy' option was used \the\xydummyrequires@@\space times!}}
\DOCMODE)

	(|\W@| is an \Xy-pic primitive that outputs its argument.)

	Then the option ends:

\DOCMODE(
\xyendinput
\DOCMODE)

	Finally |xydummy.doc| is maintained using RCS and thus contains the
	following revision log:
