\W{Description: Xy-pic is a package for typesetting graphs and diagrams.}
\W{ It is structured as several modules, each defining a custom notation for}
\W{ a particular kind of graphical object or structure.  Example objects are}
\W{ arrows, curves, frames, and colouring/rotation on drivers that support}
\W{ it; these can be organised in matrix, directed graph, path, polygon, knot,}
\W{ and 2-cell structure.  Xy-pic works with most formats, including LaTeX,}
\W{ AMS-LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and plain TeX, and has been used to typeset}
\W{ complicated diagrams from many application areas including category}
\W{ theory, automata theory, algebra, neural networks, and database theory.}
\W{}
\W{Keywords: diagram, picture, graph, arrow, curve, commutative diagram.}
