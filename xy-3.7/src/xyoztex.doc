\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This driver provides the necessary interface to support the \PS\ back-end and
other \PS\ effects when using the DVI driver of versions 1.8+ of \OzTeX\ by
Andrew Trevorrow,\footnote{\OzTeX\ is a shareware implementation of \TeX\ for
Macintosh available from many bulletin boards and ftp sites; v1.5 and earlier
versions were freeware. Email contact: <akt@kagi.com>.}  "Earlier versions 
of \OzTeX\ should instead use the driver option |\xyoption{17oztex}|."

Effects such as colour, line-thickness and rotated or scaled diagrams are
only partially supported in that the effects cannot be applied to any text or
symbols placed using fonts. This is due to the nature of \OzTeX\ <driver>,
whose optimization of the placement of font-characters precludes the
applicability of such effects.  Furthermore the \PS\ dictionary must be
available in a file called |global.ps| or appended to the
|OzTeXdict.pro|. However with version 1.8 and later of \OzTeX, there is the
alternative of using the |dvips| <driver>, which does support all the \PS\
effects available in \Xy-pic.

\NOTE: To use \Xy-pic effectively with \OzTeX\ requires changing several
memory parameters. In particular a `Big-\TeX' is needed, along with an
increase in the |pool_size| parameter. Explicit instructions are contained 
in the file |INSTALL.|\-|OzTeX| of the \Xy-pic distribution.

The 68 colours are those that |dvips| recognizes by name, 
thanks to Tomas Rokicki.

\DOCMODE)

The \PS\ operators |@bxy| and |@exy| are defined in |xyps-ps| for bypassing
the mechanism used in \OzTeX\ to isolate code passed in |\special| commands.
Although it is possible (albeit difficult) to devise \PS\ to deduce the 
current location for use with the ``raw'' specials, this information cannot 
be used to do rotations and scaling as with other <driver>s. 
Hence the value of |\xyPScurrpt@@| is taken to be empty.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\OzTeXCurrpt@{\let\xyPScurrpt@@=\OzTeXCurrpt@@}%
\xydef@\OzTeXCurrpt@@{\PSraw@@{xyp}}
\DOCMODE)

\medskip

This avoids dumping the dictionary into the dvi-file, making sure
that instead it goes into a file, specified by |\xyPSdictname|,
which defaults to |global.ps|.

 \ifx\undefined\xyPSdictname\def\xyPSdictname{global.ps}\fi}
 
\xydef@\xyOzTeXheader#1#2#3{\UsePSdict@@true}
\DOCMODE)

The parameters |#1#2#3| of |\xyOzTeXheader| gobble tokens 
that are unnecessary with \OzTeX.

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item rotated/scaled diagrams and text, recognised but not supported.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In fact \OzTeX\ cannot support rotations and scaling. 
Instead we go through all the motions of providing \PS\ support, 
then set a flag that causes a limited number of warning messages to be 
generated as requests are made for these effects. 

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\oztexRotate@@{\OzTeXRotate@}

\xydef@\OzTeXRotate@{\OzTeXPStypes@
 \expandafter\ifx\csname xyps-psloaded\endcsname\empty\DN@{%
  \xyinputorelse@{xyps-r}{\xydrivernoload@{ps-r}}%

 \else\DN@{\xydriverfail@{rotations are}\UnloadRotate@\relax}\fi
 \next@ }
\DOCMODE)

This never worked properly. It requires too much hacking at Trevorrow's
code for little gain, since text-rotation can never work anyway.
Use the \dvips\ option instead!

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\OzTeXRotScale@{%
 \def\xyrot@start(##1){%
  {xyp xyt ##1\space xyr}{OzXy begin gsave}}% 
 \def\xyscale@start(##1,##2){%
  {xyp xyt ##1\space##2\space xys}{OzXy begin gsave}}%
 \def\xyrot@end{grestore end}\def\xyscale@end{grestore end}}
\DOCMODE)

The default code will just do nothing as far as the output is concerned...

\DOCMODE(
\let\OzTeXRotScale@=\xyRotScale@@
