This option provides the command to install definitions for the 68 colours 
recognised by name by Tomas Rokicki's |dvips| driver~\cite{dvips}.  
This command must be called from a <driver>-file which can actually
support the colours.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\DOCHEADER

The colour definitions themselves are in the file |xyps-col.tex|.
They are not loaded directly here since it is not known which <driver> is
to be used. Different <driver>s may redefine the |\xynewcolor@| macro
to set the colour by name or colour-model.
