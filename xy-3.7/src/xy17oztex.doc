This option provides the necessary interface to support the \PS\ back-end and
other \PS\ effects when using the DVI driver of version 1.7 of \OzTeX\ by
Andrew Trevorrow,\footnote{\OzTeX\ is a shareware implementation of \TeX\ for
Macintosh available from many bulletin boards and ftp sites; v1.5 and earlier
versions were freeware. Email contact: <akt@kagi.com>.}  "Later versions 
of \OzTeX\ should instead use the driver option |\xyoption{oztex}|."
Upgrading to version 1.9+ of\OzTeX\ is recommended.

Does not support rotations, scaling and coloured text within diagrams and the
\PS\ dictionary must be available in a file called |global.ps|.

\NOTE: To use \Xy-pic effectively with \OzTeX\ requires changing several
memory parameters. In particular a `Big-\TeX' is needed, along with an
increase in the |pool_size| parameter. Explicit instructions are contained in
the file |INSTALL.|\-|OzTeX| of the \Xy-pic distribution.

The \PS\ operators |@boxy| and |@eoxy| are defined in |xyps-ps| for bypassing
the mechanism used in \OzTeX\ to isolate code passed in |\special| commands.
Although it is possible (albeit difficult) to devise \PS\ to deduce the 
current location for use with the ``raw'' specials, this information cannot 
be used to do rotations and scaling as with other <driver>s. 
Hence the value of |\xyPScurrpt@@| is taken to be empty.

This avoids dumping the dictionary into the dvi-file, making sure
that instead it goes into a file, specified by |\xyPSdictname|,
which defaults to |global.ps|.

% The parameter |#1| in this next macro is to gobble the |\dumpPSdict@| 
% which would otherwise dump the dictionary into the dvi-file. However
% if |\xyPSdictname| is defined then this dump must occur into a file.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In fact \OzTeX\ cannot support rotations and scaling. 
Instead we go through all the motions of providing \PS\ support, 
then set a flag that causes a limited number of warning messages to be 
generated as requests are made for these effects.
