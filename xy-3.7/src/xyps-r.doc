\subsection{Rotations and scaling}

The included file |xyps-r.tex| (version \stripRCS$Revision: 3.7 $) provides 
\PS\ support for the effects defined in the |rotate| extension described
in~\S??g[:rotate].

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \PS\ style methods are required, so ensure that they are loaded.

\DOCMODE(
\expandafter\ifx\csname xyps-sloaded\endcsname\empty\else
 \xyinputorelse@{xyps-s}{\xyerror@{Could not load xyps-s}{}}%
 \xycatcodes\fi
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This file is loaded and its effects are activated automatically whenever
|\xyoption{rotate}| is requested and the current <driver> supports 
\PS\ rotations. Should there be any need to turn off this support,
the following commands are available; they obey usual \TeX\ groupings.
%
\begin{defs}
|\NoPSrotate| & remove \PS\ support\kern-50pt\cr
|\UsePSrotate| & reinstate \PS.
\end{defs}
%
Without \PS\ support diagrams can be expected to be displayed unrotated
and unscaled.  
These commands are provided primarily for testing and trouble-shooting; 
\eg~with <driver> configurations untested by the authors of \Xy-pic, 
who should be notified of persistent difficulties. 

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{Installation}

Call the following macro to allow the \PS\ mechanisms to be used.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\installPSrotscale@{\installPSstyle@
 \let\xyRotate@@=\xyPSrotate@@
% \let\xySpecialRotate@@=\xyPSspecialRotate@
 \let\doSpecialRotate@@=\doPSspecialRotate@@
% \let\xyRotnamed@=\xyPSpsxy@
% \let\xyRot@named@=\xyPSrot@named@@
 \let\xyscale@@=\xyPSscale@@
 \xyPSshapes@true
 \xyuncatcodes }

\xydef@\UsePSrotate{\installPSrotscale@}
\xydef@\NoPSrotate{\UnloadRotate@\relax}
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

All effects defined in the |rotate| extension can be implemented using a \PS\ 
<driver>. However different <driver>s need not handle things in the same way; 
different \PS\ code may be required to match the specific environment used
by the <driver>. 

This file provides generic \PS\ code which is known to work correctly with 
most drivers. It is written so as to indicate where modifications may be 
made to accomodate specific <driver>s. For such driver-specific variations, 
consult the appropriate <driver>-file, called |xy|<driver>|.doc|.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{Transform lists}

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\xyPSpretransform@{\xyPSrawA@{\preXYtransform@@}}
\xydef@\xyPSposttransform@{\xyPSrawZ@{\postXYtransform@@}}

\let\preXYtransform@=\xyPSpretransform@
\let\postXYtransform@=\xyPSposttransform@

\xydef@\xyPSrotSplit@{%
 \expandafter\def\expandafter\preShape@@\expandafter{\xyPSpre@}%
 \expandafter\def\expandafter\postShape@@\expandafter{\xyPSpost@}}
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{Rescaling}

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\xyPSscale@@#1#2{%
 \xyPSsplitPS@{\xyscale@start(#1,#2)}{\xyscale@end}%
 \xyPSrotSplit@\xyPSpsxy@ }
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{Rotations}

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\xyPSrotate@@#1{% 
 \xyPSsplitPS@{\xyrot@start(#1 xyd)}{\xyrot@end}%
 \xyPSrotSplit@\xyPSpsxy@ }

\xydef@\xyPSspecialRotate@#1{%
 \xyPSsplitPS@{\xyrot@start(#1)}{\xyrot@end}\xyPSrotSplit@\xyPSpsxy@ }

\xydef@\doPSspecialRotate@@#1@@{\xyPSspecialRotate@{#1}}
\DOCMODE)

The \PS\ operator |xyr| is defined in |xyps-ps.doc|, to store the given
parameter as a rotation angle.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{Shearing}

This feature is not implemented yet.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{PostScript commands}

The \PS\ codes to start the rotation or scaling are given as functions, 
|xyrot@start| and |xyscale@start| with arguments to include a specification 
of the rotation-angle or scaling factors. 

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\xyRotScale@@{%
 \def\xyrot@start(##1){{xyt ##1\space xyr}}%
 \def\xyscale@start(##1,##2){{xyt ##1\space##2\space xys}}%
 \def\xyrot@end{}\def\xyscale@end{}}
\DOCMODE)

These strings are placed using |\xyPSsplitPS@| so as to correctly
occur before and after the code for the actual <object> being typeset.
This is always followed by |\xyPSpsxy@|, which results in \PS\ code
to identify the current position, storing it with keys |xyXpos| and |xyYpos|
so as to be accessible to the code for the rotation or scaling.

A specific <driver> must either call |\xyRotScale@@| to use this default
mechanism, or define its own macro to be called at installation time, 
which sets alternative expansions to |\xyrot@start(#1)|, 
|\xyscale@start(#1,#2)|, |\xyrot@end| and |\xyscale@end|.
