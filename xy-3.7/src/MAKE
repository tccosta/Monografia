  -2- MAKING THE PACKAGE AND MANUAL FROM SOURCES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes how to make the Xy-pic package from sources on
a un*x system.  Making Xy-pic requires use (and some knowledge) of
several standard un*x utilities; furthermore the typesetting og the
reference manual needs a **LARGE** TeX (see below), and full
installation requires both the plain TeX and LaTeX2e formats as well
as METAFONT (with the plain and cm bases.

NOTE FOR VMS USERS: The procedure for making the package from sources
described below does not work on VMS, of course.  You can, however,
run the enclosed `support/doc2tex.com' procedure file contributed by
R.Gaertner to create the .tex files from the .doc files.

NOTE FOR OTHER NON-UN*X USERS: If you do not have a un*x system then
you are best adviced to get the `ready to run' package and install it
as described in `INSTALL'.

UN*X GENERATION AND INSTALLATION STEPS:

1. First make sure that you have a separate directory `src' which
   contains all the files of the distribution (including this file).

   The file `MANIFEST' contains a list of the files.

2. Next you should edit the `Configuration section' of `Makefile' to fit
   the configuration of your system by following the directions given
   there.

   When you have configured everything then just do

	make

   which should generate all the files needed to use the package.

3. You can test the newly generated system by typesetting the User's
   Guide which you probably want for reference anyway: do

	make guide

   which should produce a file `xyguide.dvi' by running LaTeX several
   times and BibTeX once.

4. If possible it is a good idea to try to preview the User's Guide (in
   whatever way you do on your system) at this point.  This is slightly
   difficult because it uses the Xy-pic fonts which you haven't
   installed yet, so the previewer should be instructed to look in the
   current directory before looking in the system font directories.  The
   following show how to do this for the most common previewer (on un*x
   systems with X windows) and might work for you:

	env XDVIFONTS=.: xdvi xyguide.dvi

5. You can then install the package by ensuring that the install
   directories in `Makefile' are setup correctly and do

	make install

   This will replace exisiting `xypic.tex' and `xypic.sty' files with
   the new (compatibility mode) ones; the old ones will remain available
   with an `.orig' suffix (if you want to keep the old version then read
   section 2 of `INSTALL').

6. You can typeset the entire manual with

	make manual

   to create both files `xyguide.dvi' and `xyrefer.dvi'; they can be
   installed in the TEXDOC directory with the command

	make install.manual

   NOTE: this requires a LARGE TeX system: the last typesetting (running
   LaTeX on `xyrefer.man' without any driver) uses more than 600000 TeX
   words, as noted above.  Using Karl Berry's Web2C 7.0 this is
   achieved by including the lines

extra_mem_top = 400000 % extra high memory for chars, tokens, etc.
extra_mem_bot = 400000 % extra low memory for boxes, glue, breakpoints, etc.

   in the texmf.cnf file.

7. You can build format files by the commands

	make xytex.fmt
	make xylatex.fmt

   (the latter requires the new standard LaTeX release aka LaTeX2e).
   These assume that the files `plain.tex' and `latex.ltx' are available
   in the TeX search path; also you have to install the format files in
   the appropriate place yourself.

That is all.
