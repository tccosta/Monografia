This driver provides support for extensions when using variants of the 
|xdvi| driver, by Eric Cooper, Bob Scheifler, Mark Eichin and others. 
It has been used successfully with |xdvi| patchlevel 20, by Paul Vojta,
and |xdvik| version~18f, by Karl Berry.

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Some of the supported features assume that the implementation of |xdvi| is
linked to a \PS\ renderer; e.g. {\it Ghostscript} or {\sc Display \PS}.
If such support is not available, then invoking |xdvi| using the command
|xdvi -hushspecials| will suppress warning messages that might otherwise
be produced. 
One drawback of such a setup is that much of the \PS\ is not
rendered until after all of the font characters, etc. have been placed on
the page. Thus text that was meant to be placed on top of a filled or
patterned region may appear to be obscured by it. However when printed,
using a \PS\ printer, the correct placement is obtained.

Supported |\special| effects are...
%
\begin{itemize}

\item colour, using \PS.

Not all versions of |xdvi| support color |\special|s, so there is no direct
support for colour. However parts of pictures rendered using \PS\ may 
appear coloured, due to interpretation of colour commands within the \PS. 

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Disable the |\xylocalColor@| but enable the |\xycolor@| for use by \PS.

\DOCMODE)

If neither support file |colordvi.tex| nor |colordvi.sty| can be found,
then the normal colour support will not be available. However the colour
support for the \PS\ back-end can still be used.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\NoXDVIcolordvi@{\xywarning@{%
 Neither  colordvi.tex  nor  colordvi.sty  could be found.}%
 \xyBEcolorcheck@}%
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item crayon colours.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The 68 colours that |xdvi| recognizes by name are not loaded unless the 
|crayon| option has been requested. 

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\xdviCrayola@@{\xdviColor@@\xdviCrayola@}

\xydef@\xdviCrayola@{%
 \let\prevxycolor@=\newxycolor@

  \let\newxycolor@=\newxyXDVIcolor@
  \installCrayolaColors@
 \let\newxycolor@=\prevxycolor@ }%
\DOCMODE)

Although any order of loading options: |ps|, |xdvi|, |color| and |crayon|
produces the desired result visually, the \PS\ code can be different
with different loading order. The most easily readable is obtained when
|crayon| is requested last.

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item \PS\ back-end.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The latest versions of |xdvi| recognise most forms of |\special| command
that are recognised by |dvips|; these are used to support \PS\ effects.

\catcode`\^^M=\active %
 \gdef\next{\catcode`\^^M=\active \let^^M=\space }}%
\xylet@\obeyXDVIlines@=\next
\DOCMODE)

All the \PS\ definitions passed to |xdvi| by reading the 
dictionary file are stored in a \PS\ dictionary which it defines, 
called |SDict|. This must be the current dictionary whenever an \Xy-ps 
command is to be executed. 
This will be the case whenever the |\special{" |{\it commands}|}| or 
|\special{! |{\it commands}|}| forms are used, but not when the
|\special{ps:: |{\it commands}|}| form is used.
Thus the |\xdviSpecial@| macro includes code to open |SDict| and 
close it when finished; so also does the |\xdviRaw@| type, since this
is used with \Xy-pic\ \PS\ operators whose definitions have been placed
within |SDict|.

The |currentpoint| is defined for the ``raw'' specials.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\xdviCurrpt@{\let\xyPScurrpt@@=\xdviCurrpt@@}%
\xydef@\xdviCurrpt@@{\PSraw@@{xyp}}
\DOCMODE)

The \PS\ operator called |xyp| is defined in |xyps-ps| for storing the
location read from |currentpoint|.

\medskip

This installs the \PS\ backend.
