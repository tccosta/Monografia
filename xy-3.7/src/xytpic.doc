This option allows the \Xy-pic fonts to be replaced by \TPIC\ |\special|s,
when used with a dvi-driver capable of supporting them. Extra capabilities
include smoother lines, evenly spaced dotted/dashed curves, variable
line-widths, gray-scale fills of circles, ellipses and polygonal regions.

Use of \TPIC\ |\special|s offers an alternative to the \Xy-pic fonts. However
they require a dvi-driver that is capable of recognizing and interpreting
them. One such viewer is |xdvik|, Karl Berry's modification to the |xdvi|
viewer on \unix\ systems running X-windows or a derivative.  |dvipsk|, Karl
Berry's modification to |dvips| also handles \TPIC\ |\special|s, so
|xdvik|/|dvipsk| is an good combination for quality screen-display and
\PS\ printing. 

Once loaded using |\xyoption{tpic}|, with an appropriate <driver> also
specified either already or subsequently, the following commands are
available to turn the \TPIC\ backend off/on.
%
\begin{defs}
|\NoTPICspecials| & turns off \TPIC\ specials.\kern-50pt\cr
|\UseTPICspecials| & reinstates \TPIC\ specials.\kern-30pt

There is a limit to the number of points allowable in a path. For paths 
constructed by \Xy-pic, which includes spline curves, when the limit 
is reached the path is automatically flushed and a new path commenced.
The following command can be used to customise this limit---initially
set at $300$ for use with \xdvi---to suit alternative <driver>s.

\begin{defs}
|\maxTPICpoints{|<num>|}| & set maximum for paths

Each object involving \TPIC\ |\special|s must set the style, using
|\xytpic@set@| to store a macro as the expansion of |\xytpic@style@@|.
Currently this is global, since a \TPIC\ object must be completed once
it has been started --- perhaps this is not necessary.

Note that |\xytpic@set@| uses |\xdef|, but has a |\noexpand| in its 
expansion; this forces expansion of the argument, when there is one,
to the control sequence passed as the first token following |\xytpic@set@|.

\paragraph*{spline curves}

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent
Of the curves defined in the |xycurve| extension, only solid spline curves 
are supported. This is done by treating the spline as a polygon (poly-line) 
with many segments. The dotted or dashed variants do not work correctly. 

Implementations of \TPIC\ draw dashed polygons such that the start and 
finish of each segment is solid. Since these segments can be very short, 
the effect is simply to create a solid line. Similarly the shortness of the 
segments tends to give nothing at all for large portions of a dotted curve.
What is needed is an implementation whereby the on/off nature of a dashed
or dotted polygon is determined by the accumulated length, not the length 
along just the current segment.
