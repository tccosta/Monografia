	This included file provides some common ??w![idioms] whose definition
	depends on the used format such that \Xy-pic can use predefined
	??w![dimension registers] etc.\ and yet still be independent of the
	format under which it is used.	The current ??w![version]
	(\stripRCS$Revision: 3.4 $) handles ??w![plain \TeX] (version 2
	and 3~\cite{K84:TeXbook}), ??w![\AMS-\TeX] (version 2.0 and
	2.1~\cite{S90:JoyT}), ??w![\LaTeX] (version 2.09~\cite{L86:LaTeX}
	and~$2\varepsilon$~\cite{L94:LaTeX}), ??w![\AMS-\LaTeX] (version 1.0,
	1.1~\cite{AMS91:AMS-LaTeX}, and~1.2), and eplain (version
	2.6~\cite{B94:ExpandedPT})\footnote{The `v2' feature introduces some
	name conflicts, in order to maintain compatibility with earlier
	versions of \Xy-pic.\hfill}.

\paragraph*{Header:}
\DOCHEADER
\noindent
	This is a separate file so that we can abort the definitions easily
	using |\endinput|.

\paragraph*{Scratch registers:}
%
	All the formats currently treated allow the use of the following
	plain \TeX\ ??w![scratch register conventions]
	(\cf~\cite[p.346]{K84:TeXbook})
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
	|\count@| is available as a local scratch counter register.
\item
	|\dimen@|, |\dimen@i|, |\dimen@ii|, |\dimen3| to |\dimen9|, and
	|\dimen255| are available as scratch dimension registers.
\item
	|\skip@|, |\skip1| to |\skip9|, and |\skip255| are available as
	scratch skip registers.
\item
	|\toks@| and |\toks1| to |\toks9| are available as scratch token
	lists.
\item
	|\boxz@| and |\box1| to |\box9| are available as scratch box
	registers.
\end{itemize}
%
	with the constraint that ??c![\global] should never (always)
	be used when assigning to number 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 255 (1, 3, 5, 7,
	and 9).

\paragraph*{\Xy-specific scratch registers:}
%
	We first give new names to dimension registers 4, 6, and 8, since
	none of the formats do that: |\A@|, |\B@|, and |\R@| are specific to
	\Xy-pic and will be referred to as ??w![$A$], ??w![$B$], and
	??w![$R$] in comments.

\DOCMODE(
\xywarnifdefined\A@ \dimendef\A@=4
\xywarnifdefined\B@ \dimendef\B@=6
\xywarnifdefined\R@ \dimendef\R@=8
\DOCMODE)

	Some shared scratch registers are defined last.

\paragraph*{Idioms:}
%
	First check that |\undefined| is indeed undefined\dots or rather: the
	same as an extremely unlikely control sequence that we are making up:

\DOCMODE(
\ifx\undefined\AveryUNLIKELYc@ntr@lSEQUENCE@@\else
\errmessage{Xy-pic Error: \string\undefined\space defined.}\fi
\DOCMODE)

	These idioms are so common they are just conditionally defined:

\DOCMODE(
\ifx\undefined\literal@	\def\literal@#1{#1}\fi
\ifx\undefined\eat@	\def\eat@#1{}\fi

\xydef@\xyFN@{\futurelet\next} % Now private because of AMS-LaTeX change.
\ifx\undefined\DN@	\def\DN@{\def\next@}\fi
\ifx\undefined\DNii@	\def\DNii@{\def\nextii@}\fi

\ifx\undefined\setboxz@h\def\setboxz@h{\setbox\z@\hbox}\fi
\ifx\undefined\wdz@	\def\wdz@{\wd\z@}\fi
\ifx\undefined\boxz@	\def\boxz@{\box\z@}\fi

\ifx\undefined\W@	\def\W@{\immediate\write16 }\fi

\ifx\undefined\space@	\def\space@.{\futurelet\space@\relax}\space@. \fi

\ifx\undefined\notempty	\def\notempty#1{T\if @#1@F\else T\fi}\fi
\DOCMODE)

\paragraph*{Delayed setup:}
%
	This is used when it is advantageous to delay loading of something
	until after the preamble, \ie, after all options, \etc, have been
	loaded.  This is particularly true for nested ??c![\xywithoption]
	uses that will otherwise be executed repeatedly. Currently properly
	supported with \LaTeXe\ and the |amsppt| style of \AMS-\TeX.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\xysetup@dummy#1{\xyuncatcodes#1}
\xywarnifdefined\xysetup@@

\ifx\AtEndDocument\undefined
 \expandafter\ifx\csname amsppt.sty\endcsname\relax
  \let\xysetup@@=\xysetup@dummy
 \else
  \def\xysetup@@#1{%
   \expandafter\def\expandafter\topmatter\expandafter{\topmatter
    #1\xyuncatcodes}}\fi
\else
 \def\xysetup@@#1{\AtBeginDocument{#1\xyuncatcodes}}
\fi

\ifx\xysetup@@\xysetup@dummy\else
 \xysetup@@{\let\xysetup@@=\xysetup@dummy \xyuncatcodes}\fi
\DOCMODE)

	Similarly, the following provides a place to insert `trailing
	messages' if the format supports it; otherwise it just throws away
	the argument (useful for repeating the most important warnings).

\DOCMODE(
\xywarnifdefined\xyclosedown@@

\ifx\AtEndDocument\undefined \let\xyclosedown@@=\eat@
\else \def\xyclosedown@@#1{\AtEndDocument{#1}}\fi
\DOCMODE)

	This may be useful to hook into specialised mechanisms for including
	|\special| material on the page.

\DOCMODE(
\xylet@\xy@begindvi=\literal@
\DOCMODE)

	For example, \LaTeXe\ (post Dec~'94) defines an |\AtBeginDvi| macro
	to allow zero-sized material to be placed at the beginning of each
	shipped-out page. Among other uses, this allows such material not to
	be discarded, when on a page containing only floats.  This is used by
	\Xy-pic in connection with the \PS\ header dictionary |xyps-ps.doc|.

\DOCMODE(
\ifx\undefined\AtBeginDvi\else
 \AtBeginDocument{\let\xy@begindvi=\AtBeginDvi}
 \AtBeginDvi{\global\let\xy@begindvi=\literal@}\fi
\DOCMODE)

\paragraph*{Shared scratch registers:}
%
	Everything else in this file is also done by \AMS-\TeX\ so we exit
	here when using that format after renaming their |\toks@@| to
	|\toks@ii|\dots

\DOCMODE(
\ifx\amstexloaded@\relax
\xylet@\toks@ii=\toks@@ \endinput \fi
\DOCMODE)

	Thus the job of allocating scratch registers is simple except for
	counters where we only have one so we use \LaTeX\ scratch counters
	when available and otherwise allocate two new ones:

\DOCMODE(
\ifx\@tempcnta\undefined
\xynew@{count}\count@@
\xynew@{count}\count@@@
\else
\xylet@\count@@=\@tempcnta
\xylet@\count@@@=\@tempcntb
\fi
\DOCMODE)

	Finally the second scratch token register not available with \LaTeX.

\DOCMODE(
\ifx\undefined\toks@ii	\toksdef\toks@ii=2 \fi
\DOCMODE)

\paragraph*{End \& log:}
%
	That's all.

\DOCMODE(
\endinput
