\subsection{Line-styles}

The included file |xyps-l.tex| (version \stripRCS$Revision: 3.7 $) provides 
\PS\ support for the effects defined in the |line| extension described
in~\S??g[:line].

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \PS\ style methods are required, so ensure that they are loaded.

\DOCMODE(
\expandafter\ifx\csname xyps-sloaded\endcsname\empty\else
 \xyinputorelse@{xyps-s}{\xyerror@{Could not load xyps-s}{}}%
 \xycatcodes\fi
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This file is loaded and its effects are activated automatically whenever
|\xyoption{line}| is requested and the current <driver> supports 
\PS\ line styles. Should there be any need to turn off this support,
the following commands are available; they obey usual \TeX\ groupings.
%
\begin{defs}
|\NoPSlines| & remove \PS\ support\kern-50pt\cr
|\UsePSlines| & reinstate \PS.
\end{defs}
%
Without \PS\ support lines can be expected to be displayed in the default 
style, having thickness of $.4$pt.  
These commands are provided primarily for testing and trouble-shooting; 
\eg~with <driver> configurations untested by the authors of \Xy-pic, 
who should be notified of any difficulties. 

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{Installation}

The <driver>-file must call the following macro to rebind a control sequence 
defined in |xyline|, thereby allowing the \PS\ method to be used.
The purpose of the |\xyPSlinew@| hook is to allow the \PS\ style sequencing
method to be used with other back-ends, changing just the contents of the
|\special|s actually placed.

This, and the rebindings below, is all that is needed for the cleaner, 
more sophisticated way.

}

The \PS\ operators |lw|, |lc|, |lj|, |ml| are defined in |xyps-ps| to set the 
|linewidth|, |linecap|, |linejoin|, |miterlimit| graphics-state parameters,
respectively.
