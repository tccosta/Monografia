\subsection{Patterns and tiles}

The included file |xyps-t.tex| (version \stripRCS$Revision: 3.7 $) provides
\PS\ support for the effects defined in the |tile| extension described
in~\S??g[:tile].

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \PS\ style methods are required, so ensure that they are loaded.

\DOCMODE(
\expandafter\ifx\csname xyps-sloaded\endcsname\empty\else
 \xyinputorelse@{xyps-s}{\xyerror@{Could not load xyps-s}{}}%
 \xycatcodes\fi
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This file is loaded and its effects are activated automatically whenever
|\xyoption{tile}| is requested and the current <driver> supports 
\PS\ patterns. Should there be any need to turn off this support,
the following commands are available; they obey usual \TeX\ groupings.
%
\begin{defs}
|\NoPStiles| & remove \PS\ support\kern-50pt\cr
|\UsePStiles| & reinstate \PS.
\end{defs}
%
Without \PS\ support tile patterns can be expected to be displayed as 
solid black.  
These commands are provided primarily for testing and trouble-shooting; 
\eg~with <driver> configurations untested by the authors of \Xy-pic, 
who should be notified of any difficulties. 

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph*{Installation}

Installation consists of rebinding the macros |\xypattern@| and 
|\newxypattern@| and of reloading the standard patterns to include a 
description for \PS. This installation should be delayed till after 
|pattern| and the \PS\ <driver> have been installed.

\xylet@\UnloadPSpatterns@=\Unloadpattern@

\xydef@\UsePStiles{\installPSpatterns@}
\xydef@\NoPStiles{\UnloadPSpatterns@\relax}
\DOCMODE)

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

All effects defined in the |tile| extension can be implemented using 
the \PS\ dictionary, loaded by |xyps-ps|. 
This file provides ``generic'' \PS\ code which is known to work
correctly with most drivers. No attempt is made to provide special
code for particular drivers; for driver-specific variations, consult
the appropriate |xy|<driver>|.doc| file.
