\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This included file (version \stripRCS$Revision: 3.7 $) provides a \PS\
interface for the effects defined in the |style| extension.

\DOCHEADER

\paragraph*{\PS\ Style lists}

Note: The contents of the style lists |\preXY@style@| and |\postXY@style@| 
should be `raw' \PS\ code.

This prevents |\special|s from being inserted twice, once by |\Connect@@|
and once by |\Drop@@|, with straight lines using |\xyPSstraight@|.

\paragraph*{Installation}

The <driver>-file must call the following macro to rebind a control sequence 
defined in |xystyle|, thereby allowing the \PS\ mechanisms to be used.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\installPSstyle@{%
% \let\preXYstyle@=\xyPSprestyle@@
% \let\postXYstyle@=\xyPSpoststyle@@
 \def\preXYstyle@@{\xyPSpre@}%

 \let\xykillstyles@=\xykillstyles@@
