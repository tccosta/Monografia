This driver provides support for "all extensions" when using the \dvips\
driver by Tomas Rokicki~\cite{dvips}.  It has been tested with dvips
version~5.55a and dvipsk version~5.58f.

Supported |\special| effects are...
%
\begin{itemize}

\item colour, using direct color specials and \PS.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

DVIPS uses the colour-stack method, due to Tomas Rokicki.

 }
\DOCMODE)

If neither support file |colordvi.tex| nor |colordvi.sty| can be found,
then the normal colour support will not be available. However the colour
support for the \PS\ back-end can still be used.

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item crayon colours.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The 68 colours that |dvips| recognizes by name are not loaded unless the 
|crayon| option has been requested. 

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\dvipsCrayola@@{\dvipsColor@@\dvipsCrayola@}

\xydef@\dvipsCrayola@{%
 \let\prevxycolor@=\newxycolor@
  \def\newxyDVIPScolor@##1##2##3{\prevxycolor@{##1}{}{##1}}%
  \let\newxycolor@=\newxyDVIPScolor@ \dvipsInclude@{color.pro}%
%  \xyinputorelse@{colordvi.tex}%
%   {\NoDVIPScolordvi@\let\newxycolor@=\prevxycolor@}%
  \installCrayolaColors@
 \let\newxycolor@=\prevxycolor@ }%
\DOCMODE)

Although any order of loading options: |ps|, |dvips|, |color| and |crayon|
produces the desired result visually, the \PS\ code can be different
with different loading order. The most easily readable is obtained when
|crayon| is requested last.

\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item \PS\ back-end.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

|dvips| has three kinds of \PS\ |\special| which can be used.
These may be used with various features other than just the \PS\ backend.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\dvipsPStypes@{%
 \xyinputorelse@{xyps-ps}{\xydrivernoload@{ps-ps}}%

\xywarnifdefined\dvipsSpecial@
\xywarnifdefined\dvipsMacro@
\xywarnifdefined\dvipsDict@
\xywarnifdefined\dvipsInclude@
\xywarnifdefined\dvipsRaw@
{\catcode`\"=11 \catcode`\!=11 \catcode`\:=11
 \gdef\dvipsSpecial@#1{\special{ps:: SDict begin #1 end}}
 \gdef\dvipsMacro@#1{\firstPS@@\special{" {#1}xy}}
% \gdef\dvipsDict@#1{\special{! mark{#1}stopped cleartomark}}
 \gdef\dvipsDict@#1{\special{! #1}}
 \gdef\dvipsInclude@#1{\special{header=#1}}
 \gdef\dvipsRaw@#1{\special{ps: SDict begin #1 end}}

\catcode`\^^M=\active %
 \gdef\next{\catcode`\^^M=\active \let^^M=\space }}%
\xylet@\obeyDVIPSlines@=\next
\DOCMODE)

All the \PS\ definitions passed to |dvips| by reading the 
dictionary file are stored in a \PS\ dictionary which it defines, 
called |SDict|. This must be the current dictionary whenever an \Xy-ps 
command is to be executed. 
This will be the case whenever the |\special{" |{\it commands}|}| or 
|\special{! |{\it commands}|}| forms are used, but not when the
|\special{ps:: |{\it commands}|}| form is used.
Thus the |\dvipsSpecial@| macro includes code to open |SDict| and 
close it when finished; so also does the |\dvipsRaw@| type, since this
is used with \Xy-pic\ \PS\ operators whose definitions have been placed
within |SDict|.

The |currentpoint| is defined for the ``raw'' specials.

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\dvipsCurrpt@{\let\xyPScurrpt@@=\dvipsCurrpt@@}%
\xydef@\dvipsCurrpt@@{\PSraw@@{xyp}}
\DOCMODE)

The \PS\ operator called |xyp| is defined in |xyps-ps| for storing the
location read from |currentpoint|.

\medskip

This installs the \PS\ backend.
