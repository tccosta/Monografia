	This extension interprets the ??c![\scene] primitive of the
	??c![movie] class, setting the progress indicators to dummy values.
	The following assumes that your are familiar with the |movie| class.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\DOCHEADER
\DOCMODE3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	The size of the frame is determined by the command
%
\begin{defs1}
??c![\MovieSetup]|{width=|"width"|,height=|"height"|,|\dots|}|
\end{defs1}
\noindent\unskip
%
	(the \dots\ indicate the other arguments required by the |movie|
	class but silently ignored by the \Xy-pic |movie| extension).

        \NOTE: This extension still experimental and subject to change.  The
	only documentation is in the |movie.cls| source file.

\DOCMODE2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	The implementation mimics the aspects of the |keyval| package needed
	here, namely reading the ??c![height] and ??c![width] parameters.

\xydef@\MovieSetup#1{%
 \extractparameterm@{height}{#1}{height=2in}%
 \extractparameterm@{width}{#1}{width=2in}%
}
\DOCMODE)

	The progress macros all default to

\DOCMODE(
\xydef@\theScene{0}
\xydef@\theF{0}
\xydef@\theFr{1}
\xydef@\F#1{#1(0)}
\xydef@\Fr#1{#1(1)}
\DOCMODE)

	We need to interpret and ignore the arguments to |\scene| except the
	|*| which is used on the last scene since this means that we should
	output the scene with progress values corresponding to ``The End''.
